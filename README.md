The `README.md` file will contain comprehensive instructions covering the following aspects:

*   **Project Overview:** Briefly describe the project's purpose and functionality.
*   **Features:** List the key features implemented.
*   **Requirements:** Detail the prerequisites (Python version, Elasticsearch, Tesseract, etc.)
*   **Installation:** Step-by-step instructions for setting up the project:
    *   Clone the repository.
    *   Install Python dependencies using `pip`.
    *   Install Tesseract OCR engine (if using for images).
    *   Set up Google Drive API credentials (or Dropbox API credentials), explaining how to obtain the necessary `credentials.json` or access tokens.
    *   Configure Elasticsearch connection details (host, port).
*   **Usage:** How to run the application (e.g., Flask server) and how to use the CLI client to perform searches. Provide example commands.
*   **API Endpoints:** Document the search API endpoint with examples.
*   **High-Level Design:** Include a link to the design diagram (image or PDF).
*   **AI Assistant Usage:**  Document the specific prompts used to generate any code snippets with an AI assistant.
*   **Contributing:** Guidelines for contributions (if applicable).
*   **License:** Specify the license under which the project is distributed.

## Detailed Component Breakdown

*   **Cloud Storage Connector:** Responsible for authenticating with the chosen cloud storage service and fetching file metadata and content using the respective APIs. {Link: Google for Developers offers a Python quickstart for connecting to the Drive API https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/quickstart/python}. {Link: Dropbox has similar documentation for its Python SDK Dropbox.com https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/python}.
*   **File Downloader/Streamer:** Handles downloading or streaming file content from the cloud storage for processing.
*   **Text Extractor:** Parses the downloaded files based on their format and extracts the textual content. This module will leverage libraries like `PyPDF2`, `PyMuPDF`, or `pytesseract` for different file types.
*   **Indexer:** Takes the extracted text and file metadata (path, URL, etc.) and indexes it into Elasticsearch. This module will manage the Elasticsearch connection and interaction using the `elasticsearch` Python client.
*   **Search API:** A RESTful API built with Flask or FastAPI, accepting search queries and interacting with Elasticsearch to retrieve and return relevant documents.
*   **CLI Client:** A Python script utilizing the `requests` library to interact with the search API and display the results in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Cloud Storage:** Google Drive (or Dropbox)
*   **Text Extraction:**
    *   `PyPDF2` / `PyMuPDF` (for PDF)
    *   `pytesseract` (for PNG with Tesseract OCR engine)
*   **Indexing/Search:** Elasticsearch
*   **Web Framework (API):** Flask / FastAPI
*   **HTTP Client (CLI):** `requests`
*   **Dependencies Management:** `pip`
